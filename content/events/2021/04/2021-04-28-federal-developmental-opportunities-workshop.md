The Federal Leadership and Professional Development Seminar Series (FLPDSS) will host a cross-agency workshop focusing on developmental opportunities for federal employees. The workshop will provide information on how employees can develop themselves, and will provide insight in how supervisors develop their teams, and bring in outside talent.

Presentations will inform attendees on opportunity options including: coaching, mentoring, details to other federal agencies, formal federal experiential programs, and [USAJOBS Open Opportunities](https://openopps.usajobs.gov/). The workshop will end with a panel discussion on successful strategies for starting, sustaining, and evaluating formal mentoring programs.
