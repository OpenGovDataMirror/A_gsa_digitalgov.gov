**The Site Scanning program** automates a wide range of scans of public federal websites and generates data about website health and best practices. The program is a shared service provided by the [Technology Transformation Services](http://www.gsa.gov/tts) (TTS) at the [U.S. General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov) (GSA).

**We scan federal agencies for:**

- The presence of agency websites and subdomains
- Server status, redirect status, and the relationship between the website and its domain
- Digital Analytics Program participation
- Use of the US Web Design System
- Search engine optimization
- Third party services
- Other best practices

## Access the data directly

All scan data can be accessed through the [Site Scanning API](https://open.gsa.gov/api/site-scanning-api/) or downloaded as a [CSV or JSON file](data/). 

## Learn more about the program, the scans, and the underlying data

Much deeper program detail can be found in the program's [documentation hub](https://github.com/gsa/site-scanning-documentation). The major sections include:

- [Understanding the Data](https://github.com/gsa/site-scanning-documentation#understanding-the-data)
- [About the Program](https://github.com/gsa/site-scanning-documentation#about)
- [Program Management Documentation](https://github.com/gsa/site-scanning-documentation#program-management)
- [Technical Documentation](https://github.com/gsa/site-scanning-documentation#technical)

The creation of the underlying website index is explained in the separate [Federal Website Index repository](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index). It includes links to the original datasets, as well as descriptions of how they are assembled and filtered in order to create the list of URLs that are then scanned.
