# Bio — keep it under 50 words
bio: "Ben got the civic tech bug during a Code for America fellowship and is passionate about using design to help communicate the context of complex problems, visualize ideas, and shape new opportunities to improve social and civic experiences. While at 18F, he has led the TTS research guild, coached government employees in user centered design and agile practices, and led workshops to surface project goals and align teams. He works best when collaborating on cross-disciplinary teams focused on shared outcomes. He drinks both coffee and tea - but not at the same time."
