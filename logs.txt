Reduced access to department leadership impacted the Apprentices' ability to problem solve at an enterprise-wide level. When employees do not have visibility across an organization, it is also believed to stunt career growth. The CoE engagement demonstrated that the Apprentices have the ability to lead, no matter where they were previously in an organizational chart. Their leadership mirrors trends in the next generation of management — coaching — which includes listening, guiding, giving meaningful feedback, and empathy to help navigate hurdles within an organization's culture. Alongside new ways to practice human-centered leadership, they also expanded technical skill sets around the [CoE focus areas](https://coe.gsa.gov/about/approach-team-structure.html).

content/news/2016/02/2016-02-22-the-content-corner-government-as-api.md:Here at DigitalGov, we generally focus on federal governmental digital efforts within the U.S. It is where we live and operate, so it makes sense, but many governments across the world struggle with the same issues and leverage technology as a common solution. When I came across an article where Australia announced its “[government as an API](https://www.govcms.gov.au/about/news/govcms-announces-implementation-omni-channel-and-government-api)” platform was available, it seemed like a great opportunity to see how another country is tackling [structured and open content]({{< ref "2014-08-20-top-5-reasons-to-use-government-wide-open-and-structured-content-models.md" >}}).
content/news/2016/02/2016-02-22-the-content-corner-government-as-api.md:To date, govCMS hosts 51 websites with 16 currently in development, offering a choice of SaaS or Platform as a Service (PaaS) implementation for agencies that require greater flexibility, but wish to use the same codebase. The service also provides an open source and responsive design that meets Australian best practices. This coupled with the elimination of the entire vendor and procurement process (I assume Australian procurement is as time-intensive as ours) has drawn 25 Australian agencies to adopt the platform. The [latest addition to govCMS](https://www.govcms.gov.au/about/news/govcms-announces-implementation-omni-channel-and-government-api) may attract even more agencies to sign up.

We are now over two years into the MyVA transformation, a re-framing of how VA provides services and care for Veterans, and deeper more empathetic understanding of the Veterans and people that we serve. Innovation is not new to VA. Our history is full of pioneers working to improve the care of our Veterans, [such as the first successful human liver transplant in 1963](http://www.washingtondc.va.gov/about/history.asp), or the VA practitioners who first diagnosed CTE in Veterans. Now, as we continue to evolve and respond to the needs of our Veterans, we must grow the network of innovators and innovation, beyond our formidable team of clinicians, designers, scientists and storytellers at VA’s Center for Innovation. Innovation is practiced across the VA and veteran community: by epidemiologists who use predictive analytics for upstream suicide prevention and by veterans who are working with industry leaders to bring brain health training to market. As the innovation muscle at VA continues to grow, how we share the stories of innovation at VA also continues to develop.

content/news/2015/07/2015-07-17-is-it-time-to-try-medium-new-federal-friendly-terms-of-service.md:Medium’s built-in community features make it an intriguing platform for activating your organization’s content. Through [notes](https://medium.com/about/why-medium-notes-are-different-and-how-to-use-them-well-5972c72b18f2), readers can comment on specific sections of a story that resonate with them (look for the floating plus sign inside a speech bubble). Readers can also [highlight](https://medium.com/@e/highlights-have-come-to-the-medium-app-this-is-going-to-be-big-822960e8653d) a word or phrase to draw others’ attention to it. Instead of comments that live only at the bottom of a story, [responses](https://medium.com/the-story/medium-responses-fd6086781625) actually become their own stories that publish to the user’s own channel (increasing both visibility and accountability). Some of these features are subtle and many have not necessarily reached their full potential in terms of use. However, they provide interesting opportunities to foster an increased level of engagement with more complex or nuanced content.

[Robotics Research](https://www.roboticresearch.com/), for instance, is currently developing intelligent design response systems to aid in disaster relief scenarios.

As a different example, [Lift Labs](http://www.google.com/liftware/about/) focus is to help people with neurological disorders operate simple utensils like a fork or a spoon. Utilizing an active noise cancelling sensor system, a user experiencing hand tremors can handle the spoon.

content/news/2015/03/2015-03-04-what-is-the-digital-analytics-program-dap.md:The DAP team receives hundreds of monthly helpdesk requests from current and prospective customers.

Additionally, the team offers quarterly in-person [training sessions and webinars]({{< ref "/about/digitalgov-university.md" >}}) to help users drill for data as well as to take note of the most common pain points. As part of the Digital Government Division at GSA, the DAP also asks users to complete a yearly customer experience survey, and the feedback is transformed into actionable plans for the next year. It goes without saying that without the active participation and engagement of the dedicated points of contact across government, the program would not be able to offer the expansive view of government websites that it does.

I think the Android &#8216;fragmentation&#8217; issue is being reduced and is a little overhyped, as [more than 93% of active Android devices are on version 4.0 or newer](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html?utm_source=suzunone).

content/communities/open-gov.md:In 2009, the White House issued an unprecedented [Open Government Directive](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/open/documents/open-government-directive) requiring federal agencies to take immediate, specific steps to achieve key milestones in transparency, participation, and collaboration. Agencies have set forth those steps in biennial Open Government Plans available on [each agency’s Open Government website](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/open/about/working-group). The Interagency Open Government Working Group launched in early 2010 as a forum for open government professionals across agencies to share best practices to promote transparency, participation, and collaboration. The Group meets monthly and opens its meetings to civil society colleagues on a quarterly basis. In 2011, the open government efforts were expanded with the launch of the [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) U.S. efforts with the Open Government Partnership are set forth in biennial Open Government National Action Plans (NAP)  that detail specific and measurable open government commitments.
