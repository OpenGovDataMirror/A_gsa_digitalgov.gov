alt      : "A graphic shows blue and black geometric shapes with text on a white background. A vertical double-headed arrow, colored with a top-down gradient merging blue and black, is on the left. It is to indicate the extent each group is focused on more; Strategy (in blue at the top), versus Execution (in black at the bottom). To the right of the arrow, the PIFs are represented by a blue equilateral triangle pointing downward. The text on it shows that most of their work falls under the Strategy side, focusing on areas such as: Senior Leadership, Product Strategy, Data and Artificial Intelligence Strategy, Strategic Partnerships, Culture Change, and Customer Experience. To the right of the PIF triangle, 18F is represented by a black equilateral triangle pointing upward, with white text that shows that most of their work falls under the execution side, focusing on Product roadmaps, User-centered design sprints, Customer journey maps, Product builds, Agile coaching, and Content design and architecture."
