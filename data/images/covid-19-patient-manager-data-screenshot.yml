caption  : "A screenshot of the VA COVID-19 Patient Manager, with imaginary patient data." 
alt      : "A screenshot of the COVID-19 Patient Manager application. Compared to the PDF screenshot, this image is much simpler. There are clear white text box areas to input patient info. An orange in-app message guides clinicians and reads, All fields are optional, but completing the empty fields will improve the quality of recommendations. Below this message guide, a summary of recommendations appears, along with guidance on whether to admit the patient. All of this information is included neatly in one screen, with a clean and clear grey, white, and black color scheme, with key info highlighted in orange, and calls to action in blue."
