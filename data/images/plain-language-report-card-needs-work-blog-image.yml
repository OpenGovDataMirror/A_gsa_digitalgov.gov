On the right, a header in red text texts says, Aims to provide resources but may overwhelm. Below that is a list of five sentences in black text, each with an arrow pointing to corresponding examples on the web page. One: A graphic that doesn’t convey much information visually dominates the top of the page. Two: Users may struggle to understand how information pertains to them or what they can do with it. Three: Focused on the agency, not the user. Four: Long and complex sentences that use legalistic, formal language. Five: A potentially overwhelming number of options for linked resources."
