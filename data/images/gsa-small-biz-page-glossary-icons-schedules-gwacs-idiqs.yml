alt      : "A screen capture from the Small Business page on gsa.gov shows three business models with icons and text. The first model term is Schedules, the second is GWACs (the acronym for: government-wide acquisition contracts), and the third is IDIQs (the acronym for: indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts). The glossary book icon is to the left of the first two terms to indicate that they are terms found in the glossary. All three model terms are in black text, but the first two are also underlined. Each appears below line drawings of icons in light blue; a calendar and clock for Schedules, a domed building with a flag for GWACs, and a stopwatch and two open boxes for IDIQs. Below each term is a summary sentence in blue text that links to its corresponding page."
