alt      : "A 2021 logo for the White House from its Facebook account. On a blue background, a line drawing of the white house in done in light blue, and is positioned off-center, to the right. Three lines of text are centered, and partially overlap the left half of the drawing. The first line is in large white text that says, The White House. The next line is also white text but about half the height, and gives the location, Washington. The third line is in smaller, gold text and is the shortened vanity URL for the White House website, WH.gov."
