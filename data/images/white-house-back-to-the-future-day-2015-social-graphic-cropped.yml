alt      : "A graphic created by the Obama White House to celebrate Back to the Future Day in October 2015. It is an illustration depicting a night scene with lightning coming down from the dark sky. On the right, the White House and fountain are in the background, in the foreground is an illustration of the DeLorean car used for time travel in the movie. There are fiery, reddish-orange streaks coming from the rear tires. On the left are four sections of text. One: the phrase, Great Scott!, is in dark text against a light blue ribbon shape. Two: in white text it says, It's Back to the Future Day. On this historic and cinematic occasion, we're connecting you with some of the most innovative scientists and technologists across government (and the country) for a day of asking questions, sharing, and nerding out together. Three: In between the streaks from the tires is the vanity URL in a gradient of the same colors, wh.gov/BackToTheFuture. Four: a light blue hashtag, #BackToTheFutureDay."
