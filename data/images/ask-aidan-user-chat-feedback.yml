One can collapse or close the chat at the top right of the green bar. Below that a green bubble reads, give feedback about Aidan. The form has four sections on a white background. At the top is the question, What went well?, followed by five white feedback buttons with text and button outlines in blue. They are: Answered my questions, Easy to use, Helpful, Solved my problem, and Other. The third section has a Tell us more text box that is optional. It allows entry of up to 500 characters. Within the box, someone has typed: Thank you for your help! Below that box, on the right, a counter indicates how many characters were used; 24 of 500. At the bottom is a blue button with the word Submit in white text. In the top rght corner of the feedback pop-up is a dark gray x to close the box if the user does not want to submit anything."
