alt      : "A timeline showing the activities completed by the two authors as they worked to support the equity assessment work and when the agency work was utilized to provide examples to others in the equity learning community program. There are 3 lanes stacked on one another. The top lane, in green, represents the federal administrative level that provides guidance and support to all agencies. It includes the title federal - administrative level and has a picture of Aaron Stienstra, one of the authors. The middle lane, in blue, represents the equity learning community program. The bottom lane, in purple, represents the agency level where that guidance and support was used and has a picture of the other author, Lashanda Hodge. Below all of the lanes is a timeline of months in 2021 from February to December. In each lane different activities are described and are placed above the month when the activity occurred. In April, at the agency level, the design team mapped the customer experience and that information was provided to the admin level and presented as a part of the equity learning community program. In May, the agency defined system forces and defined agency power levers. In June, the agency team defined research/engagement goals and began outreach, which was again provided to the admin level and used as another example to share with the equity learning community program when discussing stakeholder engagement."
