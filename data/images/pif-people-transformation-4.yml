alt      : "This is a photo of a big workshop in a large, open space where people are working together in a human-centered design workshop to help solve government problems. There are seven people in total working together on organizing information from a collaborative workshop. There are five people standing more closely together, touching the post-it notes. There are two other people to the left observing, listening, and taking notes to inform insights. People are engaged and the workshop is dynamic."
