On the left is an open, empty folder icon with a gold-colored exterior and dark blue interior; a dark blue building dome similar to the Capitol building is positioned above it. Behind this is a bright, two-toned yellow sun with five rays of light. In the center are the words Sunshine Week in all caps, and in bold, dark blue text with a light blue drop shadow. The next line is a sentence that reads, Open government is good government; it is in thin blue text. Below that is a date range, March 13 to 19, 2022. The date is in bold dark blue text on a gold ribbon with a secondary dark blue ribbon positioned beneath it."
