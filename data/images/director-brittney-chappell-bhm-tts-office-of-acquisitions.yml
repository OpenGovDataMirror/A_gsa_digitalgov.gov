Below that is her answer in white text: I am grateful to have the opportunity to simply be in a position of black representation in leadership, to show young black government employees they can be in my position. A blue horizontal line separates the question and answer. On the right, it has a photo of Brittney Chappell, with a thin, light blue border around it. Her title, Director, TTS Office of Acquisition, is in small white text below her photo."
