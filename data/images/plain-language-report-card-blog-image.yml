On the left, a header in blue text says, a guided user pathway through the content. Below that is a list of six sentences in black text, each with an arrow pointing to corresponding examples on the web page. One: Introductory text explains what users should expect and how they will use the page. Two: Action steps are ordered logically. Three: Content is chunked into manageable short sections. Four: Large, visible section headings, start with clear action verbs. Five: The less actionable information is at the bottom of the page. Six: Overall, the page is brief and to the point; no extraneous information to slow users down."
