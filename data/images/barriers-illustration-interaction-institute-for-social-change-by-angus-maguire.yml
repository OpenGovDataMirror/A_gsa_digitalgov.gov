alt      : "An illustration of three people of different heights trying to view a baseball game from behind a wooden fence is used to show different levels of customer experience across three panels. The first panel has Traditional (customer experience) CX in bold dark text above it, and a line below it that says, Assume everyone benefits from the same support. Each person stands on a box of the same height, but only the tall and medium height persons can see above the fence; the third cannot. The middle panel has OK CX in bold dark text above it, and a line below it that says, Everyone gets support to overcome rather than remove barrier. In this scene, the tall person does not need a box to see over the fence, the medium height person keeps their box to see over the fence, and the shortest person can now see over the fence by using the remaining two boxes. The third panel has Good CX above it, and the line below says, Causes of inequities or barriers are removed. Here, the fence and boxes are gone, and all can see the game clearly."
