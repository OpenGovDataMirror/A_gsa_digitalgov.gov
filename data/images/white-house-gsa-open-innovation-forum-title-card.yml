On the right third of the card, the silhouettes of three human figures looking at laptops are in orange against a background of small white dots in a circular pattern over the dark blue. On the left, five sections of text have event details against the solid, dark blue background. The first line has small text in orange in all capital letters, which reads: White House and GSA Open Innovation Forum. Below that, in large white text, is the title of the event: Building Equitable Partnerships. The next section, which has thin orange separator lines above and below it, contains two pieces of information; the description, and date and time of the event.
