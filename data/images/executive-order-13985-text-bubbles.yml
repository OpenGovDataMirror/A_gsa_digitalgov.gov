Five of them are: 1) Civil Rights; 2) Equity means the consistent and systemic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals; 3) Affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our government; 4) Address the historic failure to invest sufficiently, justly, and equally in underserved communities; and 5) Develop policies designed to advance equity."
