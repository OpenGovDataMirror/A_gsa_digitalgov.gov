alt      : "A venn diagram with two overlapping circles. The left circle is labeled Gatekeepers and lists four kinds: supervisor, agency leaders, office of comms, and legal department. A box to the left notes that this ensures appropriateness and consistency with agency style and policy. The right circle is labeled Subject matter experts and lists four kinds: analysts, researchers, scientists, and lawyers. A box to the right notes that this ensures accuracy, currency, and completeness of content. The blue shade indicates there can be some overlap in these roles."
